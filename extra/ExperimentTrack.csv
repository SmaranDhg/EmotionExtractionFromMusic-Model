Experiment,Reason,Expected Result,Observerd Result,Run Epochs,Obs. Loss Characteristic,Obs. Metrics,Remark
Added extra dense layer after resnet blocks,Negative values were being less prevalent in output,more overfitted data,low loss and very low accuracy. Accuray not going up.,47,.0222,accuracy:~0,Failed
"Changed loss function to huber loss, with threshold 0.001","I though accuracy is not getting well, because loss is squaring the differences, making loss very low. But wanted prediction have very subtle values.",Increase accuracy.,Not increase in accuracy.,100,,,
loss function: mean abs % error | metrics: mse mae,"Turned out I was tracking accuracy while, acutaully  its a regression application.",near 10 to 20% loss,loss didn't go below 100%,40,~100 or higher,mae: .234 mse~ .1to .8,Failed
"tried different learning rate, ",I thought its on some saddle point or local minima as loss was flat,loss goes bellow 100% or show some downward momment,fluctuated heavily on hight LR while stayed flat on lower value,20 to 40,~100  or higher fluction,'',Failed
"reduced numbers of Identity blocks and added the dense layers, plus make the model more wide, plus reduced the learning rate","I thought input was quite high res spectrum image so, compressing to 64 filter might made the model more uninstable same goes for lowering the learning rate",improve stability and lowering error,well it didn't dramatically reduced the loss but loss was far more stable with lower learning rate and,100,~ 100 and 99 sometimes,"""",Partial Success
